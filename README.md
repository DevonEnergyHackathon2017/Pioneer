Problem Statement:

Tubing Tally Problem (Drilling):
Provide a better way of capturing information about tubing and casing as they’re brought on site and before
they’re placed downhole. This information is currently captured in a series of disconnected, manual
processes, which increase tack time and reduce data quality / accuracy. The length measurement is one of the
more manual, time-consuming sub-processes involved. It is safe to assume that the tubing suppliers and PIC
(person in charge) all have mobile smartphones and reasonably good (though not perfect) connectivity to the
field site. If additional hardware is included in your solution
deployment, please indicate and demonstrate (with actual hardware or simulated inputs) in the presentation

Solution:
Please see the slide presentation

Mobile App:
Based on Xamarin, this mobile app prototype can work in both iOS and Android phones.
